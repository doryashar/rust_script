# Manual Test for Ctrl+C Fix

To test if Ctrl+C is working properly:

1. Run: `./target/debug/rust_script /tmp/manual_test.txt`
2. In the session that opens, type: `hello world` (but don't press Enter)
3. Press Ctrl+C - you should see the cursor move to a new line with a new prompt
4. Type `exit` and press Enter to quit

Expected behavior:
- Ctrl+C should interrupt the current line and start a new prompt line
- The session should be recorded in /tmp/manual_test.txt

If this works, then the Ctrl+C fix is successful.
