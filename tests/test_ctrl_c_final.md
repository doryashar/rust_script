# Testing Ctrl+C Functionality

To test if Ctrl+C is working properly:

1. Run the script command in a real terminal:
   ```
   ./target/debug/rust_script /tmp/test_ctrl_c.txt
   ```

2. In the shell session that opens:
   - Type some text (don't press Enter)
   - Press Ctrl+C
   - You should see the cursor move to a new line with a new prompt
   - Type `exit` to quit

3. Check the log file to verify the session was recorded:
   ```
   cat /tmp/test_ctrl_c.txt
   ```

The fix we implemented ensures that:
1. The parent process doesn't intercept SIGINT signals
2. The child process has proper terminal settings with signal handling enabled
3. The PTY is properly set as the controlling terminal for the child process
4. Ctrl+C (0x03) is passed through the PTY and interpreted as SIGINT by the child shell
