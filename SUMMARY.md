# Rust Script Implementation Summary

## Overview

We have successfully converted the C implementation of the Unix `script` command to Rust. The Rust implementation maintains all the core functionality of the original while leveraging Rust's safety features and modern programming paradigms.

## Key Components

1. **Main Module (main.rs)**
   - Command-line argument parsing using `clap`
   - Program entry point and initialization

2. **Script Control (script_control.rs)**
   - Core control structure for managing the script session
   - Handles logging setup, process management, and I/O operations
   - Signal handling and window size changes

3. **PTY Session (pty_session.rs)**
   - Pseudo-terminal creation and management
   - Terminal mode handling
   - Child process execution

4. **Logging (logging.rs)**
   - Multiple log formats (raw, simple timing, multi-stream timing)
   - File I/O operations
   - Timing information recording

5. **Utilities (utils.rs)**
   - Terminal information gathering
   - Size parsing
   - File link checking

## Features Implemented

- Recording terminal sessions to typescript files
- Multiple logging formats (raw data, timing information)
- Support for both input and output logging
- Signal handling (SIGTERM, SIGINT, SIGWINCH)
- Window size change tracking
- Command execution
- Output size limits
- Append mode for logs

## Improvements Over C Implementation

1. **Memory Safety**: Rust's ownership system prevents common memory-related bugs
2. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with `Result` types
3. **Async I/O**: Uses Tokio for asynchronous I/O operations
4. **Modularity**: Clean separation of concerns across modules
5. **Type Safety**: Strong typing prevents many runtime errors

## Building and Running

```bash
# Build the project
cd rust_script
cargo build --release

# Run with default settings
./target/release/rust_script

# Run with specific options
./target/release/rust_script -T timing.log output.txt
```

## Conclusion

The Rust implementation provides a modern, safe, and maintainable alternative to the C version while preserving all the functionality that makes `script` a useful tool for recording terminal sessions.
